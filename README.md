# customizable-parallel-sets

A plug and play dashboard for visualizing data using the Parallel Set concept. 

The Dashboard features are quite simple since you just need to import an `.csv` or `.json` file and the app will handle everything for you. The app will render the Parallel Sets correspondent to the dataset you choosed as well as it will render one sidebar for selecting/deselecting features to be considered on the Parallel Set visualization.

The app is very straighforward and simple for you to start exploring any data you want with this cool visualization.
